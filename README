Handover notes :
Efficient choices
-Separation of concerns: phone validation in its own microservice — means other services can re-use it.
-Using libphonenumber-js: robust offline validation for global numbers (fast and reliable).
-Simple frontend-api separation: React calls main API only.

Future investments:
-Operator Name Coverage — currently operatorName defaults to "N/A". To provide real carrier info:
-Integrate a paid lookup.
-Cache results calls and cost.
-Authentication & Authorization — add JWT or session-based auth if the API is public.
-Frontend UX — validation UX improvements.
